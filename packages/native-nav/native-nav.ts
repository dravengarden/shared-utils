// Native iOS navigation bridge — drives a native snapshot push/pop transition in
// the iOS Tauri shell, with a graceful no-op fallback everywhere else.
//
// WHY: returning shelf←book froze ~480ms on real iOS devices — WebKit re-composites
// the whole view in a single frame on the swipe-back gesture (mc<<paint: main
// thread idle, the compositor stalls). No web-side change fixed it (opacity /
// visibility / display hide, ripple/focus cleanup, deferred reveal — all tried).
// The fix is the Hotwire-Native technique: the native shell snapshots the current
// WKWebView, slides it with a native (UIKit) animation, and HOLDS the snapshot
// until the web says the destination is painted — so the frozen web frame is never
// seen and the transition is GPU-native-smooth.
//
// This module is the WEB half of that bridge. The native half (iOS only) registers
// a WKScriptMessageHandler named "lvNativeNav" (see ./ios/). On the PWA / Android /
// a plain browser there is no such handler, so every call here is a no-op returning
// false and the caller keeps its existing web navigation — the PWA is completely
// untouched. Android intentionally rides the web path for now.
