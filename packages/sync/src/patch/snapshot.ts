// v1 Patch implementation: a full-snapshot diff. `apply` ignores the previous
// value and returns the absolute value at `toVersion` — so it's idempotent and
// order-independent (a client keeps the highest `toVersion`, making reorder /
// dup / drop trivially convergent). O(state) on the wire; fine while synced
// states are small. A prolly-tree / Merkle op-patch can later implement the same
// `Patch` interface without touching the client/arbiter cores (REQ-3).
