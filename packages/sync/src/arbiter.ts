// Arbiter: the source of truth. Deliberately a "serializer" — it linearizes
// incoming mutations, version-stamps, and echoes a patch. No optimistic state,
// no rebase. This reference impl is for TS-backed services + the convergence
// fuzz; a Rust service (cowboy's daemon) implements the SAME contract natively
// (dedupe by MutationId, version++, emit a snapshot patch) — reusing its
// existing broadcast + cmid dedupe. That's why the heavy/correctness-critical
// engine is the CLIENT, not this.
