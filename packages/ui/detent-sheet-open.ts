// its z-index is trapped in whatever ancestor stacking context it sits in, so a
// root-level `position: fixed` element can paint OVER it. Rather than portal
// (which breaks the iframe-host case the inline design exists for), let those
// elements subscribe and hide themselves while a sheet is open. This is purely a
// JS counter + listeners — ZERO document mutation — so it preserves the
// no-side-effects property the inline design depends on.

// counter (not openCount) so an out-of-order close can't hand a new sheet a level
// that collides with one still open. Reset to 0 once the stack fully drains, so
// z stays bounded across many open/close cycles (never creeps into the modal
